# The Complete Guide to Django REST Framework

This repo is just for learning purpose, it is a clone from [pymike00/The-Complete-Guide-To-DRF-and-VueJS](https://github.com/pymike00/The-Complete-Guide-To-DRF-and-VueJS). I also followed along with his course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-django-rest-framework-and-vue-js/?referralCode=A2FA0F6C1C4BE66A3B3E). The course guides on building REST APIs with [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org) and Single Page Application using both [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [VueJS](https://vuejs.org).
